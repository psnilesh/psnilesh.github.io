  <h1 class="post-title">A closer look at Return on Equity</h1>
  <div class="post-line"></div>
  <p>Return on Equity (ROE) is one of the key performance metrics evaluated while reviewing the fundamentals of a company. While it involves little judgement and is easy to compute, in this article, I'm going to look beyond the ratio to gain an intuitive and deeper understanding about what it really conveys about the business. <!--more--> As with any financial metric, its relation to business must be closely studied before making any investment decisions.</p>
<h2 id="definition" tabindex="-1">Definition</h2>
<p>Return on Equity (ROE) measures the amount earned by the business, after servicing all its current obligations, in relation to shareholder's equity.</p>
<p>Lets take a farming as an example. Suppose you had to take a loan (a liability) of $60M and invest your own $40M to purchase a $100M farm land. Your equity, as per standard accounting equation is, $40M.</p>
<br />
![Fig 1. Accounting equation](/assets/images/investing/accounting_equation.png)
*Fig 1. Accounting equation*
<br />
<p>At the end of every year, you are obliged to pay a predetermined interest on the $60M loan undertaken to start your business (and the principal when its due). Part of the profit from selling the produce of the year in the market will go towards servicing this debt. There will be other expenses (seeds, fertilizers, manual labor, taxes etc) which will further eat into your net income. Suppose you managed to squeeze out a net income of $3M at the end of year. Then your ROE would be 7.5% ($3M as a percentage of $40M investment).</p>

<hr class="fade"/><br />
Allow me a small detour to explain a fundamental rule you should follow while forming financial ratios. In the earlier example, we financed our farm through a loan and some of our own cash. Their net ($100M) is the total capital we put into the business. While estimating business performance / returns for the year, we have two choices. We can either calculate them in relation to total capital ($100M) or just owner's equity ($40M) as done above. **If we decide to use total capital, the numerator must reflect the income earned by the firm / business, not owners**. Operating income to firm is also called EBIT (Earnings before Interest and taxes). If we do not follow this rule, we risk overestimating equity return or underestimating return on total invested capital. It is only fair to compare apples to apples, *i.e income to firm vs total capital available to the firm - or - income to owners vs owners' investment*. Your creditors have interest in business too, and portion of income goes to buying it back little at a time (interest payments). Such costs reduce owners income. Keep this in mind while creating business specific performance metrics for new companies.
<h2 id="narrative" tabindex="-1">Narrative</h2>
<p>Equations are good and all, but I prefer an verbal and intuitive explanation of any financial metric. Lets see what story ROE is telling us.</p>
<p>As with any financial metric, ROE is not much of use by itself. The progression and relative strength is what matters. A company that can invest capital at an attractive rate of return will maintain or increase ROE over time along with its shareholder's equity. A company that fails to do so, will eventually destroy shareholder wealth and likely perish. Lets look at it from two aspects.</p>
<h3 id="i-growth-aspect" tabindex="-1">i) Growth aspect</h3>
<p>Most profitable companies in the past century paid most of their income as dividends to shareholders. They only retained whats necessary to keep the business running. In modern day, companies rarely pay meaningful dividends but retain most or all of their earnings to reinvest in future growth. This led to valuations models such as Dividend Discount model, which viewed stocks as bonds with dividends as coupons, obsolete. One reason why companies prefer to reinvest heavily (unless its a capital intensive business) might be that big companies used to have a lifespan of 61 years, it's now down to 18. Unless they continuously reinvent themself, they are likely to go out of business. Irrespective of the reason, how do we measure the quality of re-investments ? When companies chose to retain earnings instead of paying them out through dividends or share buybacks, they have a moral obligation to reinvest them wisely and over a period of time, generate more than a dollar in shareholder value for every dollar retained. Ability to do so depends on how good the management is at capital allocation. As William Thorndike demonstrated in his book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/13586932">The outsiders</a>, great CEOs think of themselves as capital allocators and have created enormous wealth for shareholders in the past.</p>
<p>Lets step away form our farming business and consider another business that earned $25M on $100M shareholder's equity. That's a decent 25% ROE. Say the company decided to retain all of its earnings. At the end of the year, new shareholders equity would be $125M. <strong>Undistributed earnings increase shareholders equity</strong>. Similarly, losses decrease shareholders equity. If the companies does this for 3 more years, equity would rise to $200M. Assume the company never reinvested this money and is waiting for a bargain. Without re-investments, company is likely to earn same $25M in earnings (ignore inflation, pricing adjustments etc) in the final year against an equity base of $200M. That's a 12.5% ROE, a severe regression from year one. It is not uncommon for companies to sit on a large pile of cash until they find right opportunity (beats building luxurious headquarters or making expensive acquisitions) but its important to note that money is depreciating while they do so. Fixed income or short term securities can help offset some of that loss in purchasing power.</p>
<p>Consider another scenario where the company re-invested all of retained earnings but ended up earning only $10M in the final year. ROE dropped to 5%. This alone does not mean the investments were bad. Perhaps they need more time before they start contributing to bottom line. A closer look at those investments from companies audited financial statements should help disambiguate. In the final scenario, imagine an earnings of $30M in the final year. This would mean the ROE is 15% ($30M / $200M)- not great, but better than first scenario. Again, some of this increase might have been organic and not from the reinvested earnings. Investors must carefully go through notes accompanying financial statements of all relevant years to gain more clarity.</p>
<h4 id="relation-to-income-growth" tabindex="-1">Relation to income growth</h4>
<p>Assuming the business is growing rapidly by re-investing all of its earnings year after year, what growth in earnings can the owners expect ? Time to break out some math.</p>
<br />
![](/assets/images/investing/roe_and_growth.png)
*Fig 3. Relation b/w ROE, earnings retained and expected growth*
<br />
<p>Retention ratio is the percentage of earnings company retained for re-investing. As the above derivation shows, if a company has predicable ROE, we can expect its earnings to grow proportional to earnings retained. For instance, if ROE is 20% and 90% of earnings were retained, earnings should grow by 18% to retain ROE for the next year. This rarely plays out year by year, so an evaluation period of 3 or 5 years might be necessary to glean the truth.</p>
<p>We assumed earnings retained was the only change to equity base, but this is seldom true. Share buy backs, new issues, options etc. can also change net shareholder's equity. A common practice is to use average of shareholder's equity at beginning and end of year to smoothen some of these inconsistencies. While these theoretical formulas are good, reality is far more complex and messy. <strong>Read financial notes thoroughly before calculating any financial ratios so you can &quot;adjust&quot; the inputs to better reflect the business quality.</strong></p>
<h3 id="ii-efficiency-aspect" tabindex="-1">ii) Efficiency aspect</h3>
<p>This one is simpler. If two identical business have a more or less comparable equity base and capital structure (debt-to-equity), in most cases, superior business would be one with higher returns on equity. Emphasize on the capital structure because smaller equity base (and larger debt) can often result in really high ROE. Companies can often put debt to good use to reduce taxes on margin but over-leveraged companies can default and go bankrupt if they don't have a strong balance sheet (assets, cash &amp; equivalents) when times get rough. For this reason, it is better to compare ROEs across companies in same industries.</p>
<p>Its important to note that not all liabilities are interest bearing loans, so care must be taken not to overestimate equity base. For instance, imagine a company that receives payments from large pool of customers in return for a future service. Company does not own this money since it eventually have to be paid back to customers when their service is due. Can such a company exist ? Yes. A prime example is Berkshire Hathaway. BRK, through its insurance subsidiaries, collects premiums on underwritings from large number of clients, and pay claims to some of them when (and if) they are due. BRK gets to keep the change. More importantly, they are free to invest this money and keep the returns for themselves. Such premiums are non-interest bearing, but still a liability that needs to be distributed back to customers filing for their claim. Calculating ROE for such companies is more complex.</p>
<p>In our farming example, we earned a decent 7.5% ROE in our first year. In real world, this is rarely possible. Companies don't turn over profit, or break-even for several years. Even when they do, a capital intensive business will be highly leverage that much of its earnings would go towards interest payments. A company thats expanding and growing its operating income steadily might return a low ROE, but might be top contender for superior shareholder returns when debt is paid down. That's where another metric, Return on Capital Employed comes in. It does this by factoring in debt capital in addition to equity, but this is a tale for another day.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Return on Equity is a key metric used while evaluating performance of companies in same industries. It represents what the company earned for every dollar of shareholder equity during a certain period. It is vital that a company re-invest its earnings so as to sustain or improve its ROE to remain attractive to investors. Some companies will deliberately choose to leverage their assets to reduce taxes on margin, effectively declaring no income. While such companies might show little to no ROE on paper, they might still be contenders for high growth and shareholder wealth creation if they show steady free cash flow. I highly recommend the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/13586932">William Thorndike's book</a> mentioned earlier, which does an excellent job at explaining the importance of prudent capital allocation to shareholder prosperity.</p>
